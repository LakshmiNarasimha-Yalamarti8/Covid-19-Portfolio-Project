Performing various queries and calculations on COVID-19 data, including statistics on infection rates, death rates, vaccinations.
Providing meaningful insights from a COVID-19 dataset. 
Calculates the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in each location based on total cases and population. 
Calculates the death percentage based on the total number of cases and total deaths in each location. 
Identifies countries with the highest infection rate relative to their population. 
Likelihood of Dying by Country: Shows the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 in each country. 
Lists countries with the highest death count per population. 
Breaks down the data by continent and shows continents with the highest death count per population. 
Provides global statistics on new cases, new deaths, and the death percentage. 
Analyzes the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose by location and date. Using CTE (Common Table Expression) 
Using Temp Table for Calculations: Temporary table to store intermediate results. 
Creating a view to store data for later visualizations.

# COVID 19 Tableau Dashboard 

Created visually appealing and informative dashboard. 
Utilized appropriate Visuals and formats to effectively communicate the insights.
# Total Cases, Total Deaths, Death Percentage (Tabular Format) 
The tabular format provides a comprehensive summary of the pandemic's progression, including the total number of cases and deaths, as well as the death percentage, which indicates the severity of the outbreak. 

# Total Death Count by Continent (Bar Chart) 

Visualization: Bar chart or pie chart.
Description: 
This chart provides a visual representation of the total death count due to COVID-19 by continent. 
Each continent is represented as a separate bar or segment in the chart, with the length or size of each bar/segment corresponding to the total number of deaths in that continent. 


# Total Death Count by Location (Visual Map) 
Description: 
This map chart visualizes the total death count due to COVID-19 for various geographical locations. 
Each location (e.g., countries or regions) is represented on the map, and the color intensity on the map corresponds to the total number of deaths in each location. 
The map provides a geographical perspective of the distribution of COVID-19-related deaths, allowing viewers to see which locations have been hardest hit. 
Users can interact with the map to zoom in, explore specific regions, and view detailed information about each location's death count. 

# Highest Infection Rate by Location and Date (Time Series) 
Description: 
This time series chart tracks the highest infection rate percentage over time for different geographical locations. 
Each location has its own line or area on the chart, with the x-axis representing dates and the y-axis showing the highest infection rate percentage. 
By observing the trends in infection rates over time, viewers can gain insights into how the pandemic has evolved in various locations. 
The chart can help identify spikes in infection rates and whether certain locations experienced multiple waves of infections.
